[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.1] — 2026-08-01

### Added
- Licence texts (`LICENSE-APACHE`, `LICENSE-MIT`), the `NOTICE` that
  Apache-2.0 section 4(d) obliges a redistributor to retain, `CITATION.cff`
  with the author listed first, and this changelog.

  The crate declared `Apache-2.0 OR MIT` in its manifest and its README from
  the first release and shipped neither text. A dual-licence declaration
  without the licences does not grant what it announces: a reader who wants to
  depend on this had nothing to read, and Apache-2.0's attribution clause
  cannot be honoured against a `NOTICE` that does not exist. That is a defect
  in what the repository *is*, not in what it does, which is why it is recorded
  here rather than quietly added.

  No code changed. The version moves because the artefact a consumer receives
  is materially different: it can now be depended on under the terms it always
  claimed.
